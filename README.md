# Background
As part of Sewanee DataLab 2022, I helped Dr. Kirk Zigler and his student Carter Trapeni access data about the range and conservation status of cave-dwelling species across North America. This .py file is a presentable version of the script that I wrote to download that data using the REST API of an ecological nonprofit called NatureServe.
