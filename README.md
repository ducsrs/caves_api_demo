# Synthesizing the Conservation Status of Cave Species 


### What could go wrong?

* #### Error in code
  * Being mostly a one-man team I think it could be likely that there is a slight error in the code that could lead me to believe there are certain trends that aren’t actually true
  * Before confirming any “Big findings” I plan on running my analysis with my partner as well as my mentor to make sure that I have not come to a conclusion about data that is not true due to an error in coding 
This can also be combatted by commenting on all of my code to make sure it is understandable/reproducible 

* #### Not being creative/original enough
  * This could create an issue as this is a conservation status being synthesized from existing data, meaning that all of our data is out on the internet somewhere. With this being said, I need to create a dashboard that brings something to the table that other resources do not in order to make it effective for future use by students, researchers, professors, etc. (This may not be the entire goal, but it would be great to get that use out of the dashboard)
  * I think this can be avoided by constantly brainstorming and asking myself if my future product has attributes that no other website/data collection site has (Ex. Nature Serve)

* #### Communication Issues
  * Communication will be essential to this project, especially with my partner Dr. Zigler. Especially with a majority of this project being exploratory I have to be certain that I am not missing out on any of the concepts that Dr. Zigler wants to look into by getting distracted with other possible directions that the project could go into. 
  * To contradict this issue it will also be important to not limit myself on waiting for tasks from Dr. Zigler, but by being proactive in the data analysis process.
